WeatherCaster

Web application developed using API calls from Accuweather API to retrieve the weather data and hosted using firebase hosting.

Working:
The users can enter the city name to the text field and a brief weather data will be displayed along with a more info button which will redirect the user directly to accuweather website showing the detailed information regarding the entered city.

After cloning the application make sure to create an accuweather account and generate an API key.
Use the API key and insert it to forecast.js as shown below:

```
const key='<<enter your key here>>';

```
